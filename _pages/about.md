I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate at the University of California, Davis studying **Computer Science and Technology Management**. While I enjoy (most) of the problem-solving aspects of software engineering, my experience within the fields of design, business, and tech over the span of my academic journey has motivated me to pursue Product Management. 

Whether it was teaching myself graphic design in middle school, starting e-commerce endeavors in high school, or coming into college with zero programming skills, I found that my curiosity towards new things has always led me to enjoy the process of learning and adapting to the unknown. Knowing that the current field of product is a loosely defined space, I aim to leverage this attribute by deeply understanding the needs of the end user, while also assuring that empathy and equity are prioritized in the problem solving process.

### A little more about me

When I'm not in class or I'm not workng, I'm most likely selling stuff online, cleaning my fish tank, writing poems, learning a new skill, spending time with loved ones, reading a book, designing, exercising, cooking, eating, and most commonly, organizing something that doesn't need to be organized.
