<h3 style="color:#c08552;">Hello!</h3>

I'm currently a senior at the University of California, Davis studying **Computer Science** and **Technology Management**. While I enjoy (most) of the problem-solving aspects of software engineering, my experience within the fields of design, business, and tech over the span of my academic journey has motivated me to pursue a role in product.

Whether it was teaching myself graphic design in middle school, kick-starting e-commerce endeavors in high school, or coming into college with no programming background, I found that my curiosity towards new things has always led me to enjoy the process of learning efficiently and adapting to the unknown. Knowing that the current field of product is a loosely defined space, I aim to leverage these attributes by deeply understanding the needs of the end user, while also assuring that empathy and equity are prioritized in the problem solving process.

When I'm not in class or working, I'm most likely selling stuff online, cleaning my fish tank, writing poems, learning a new skill, spending time with loved ones, reading a book, binging YouTube, exercising, cooking, eating, and most commonly, (re)organizing something that's already organized.
