I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate at the University of California, Davis studying Computer Science and Technology Management. While I enjoy (most) of the problem-solving aspects of software engineering, my experience within the fields of design, business, and tech over the span of my academic journey has motivated me to pursue Product Management. 

Whether it was teaching myself graphic design in middle school, starting my e-commerce endeavors in high school, or coming into college with zero programming background, I found that my curiosity towards new things has always led me to enjoy the process of learning and adapting to the unknown. Knowing that the current field of product is an loosely defined space, I aim to leverage this attribute in understanding the needs of the end user, while assuring that empathy and equity are prioritized in the problem solving process.
